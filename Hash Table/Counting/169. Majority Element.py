LeetCode #169 - Majority Element
https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n / 2) times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,2,3]
    Output: 3

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2

Constraints:
    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
    -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
    The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
