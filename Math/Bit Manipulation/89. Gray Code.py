LeetCode #89 - Gray Code
https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/

An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers where:
- Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2^n - 1],
- The first integer is 0,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly
  one bit.

Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: [0,1,3,2]

Example 2:
    Input: n = 1
    Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 16
