LeetCode #11 - Container With Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines
drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The max area of water the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
    Input: height = [1,1]
    Output: 1

Constraints:
    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 10^5
    0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
