https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee
table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in
Python).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
    Input:
    Employee table:
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+
    Output:
    +---------------------+
    | SecondHighestSalary |
    +---------------------+
    | 200                 |
    +---------------------+

Example 2:
    Input:
    Employee table:
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    +----+--------+
    Output:
    +---------------------+
    | SecondHighestSalary |
    +---------------------+
    | null                |
    +---------------------+

Constraints:
    Employee table has at most 10^4 rows.
